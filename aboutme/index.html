    <p>Hi, my name is Enrique but everybody calls me Kike, I'm married and living in Washington, I'm getting a degree on web development and design.</p>
    <p>Some my hobbies are woodworking, swimming(surfing), Photography and film. I hope to learn beyond the basic knowledge I have of web design and be able to create wonderful designs.</p>
    <p>I decided to study Web delovpment and design because I couldn't decide between Industrial design and computer science, I feel that it is a nice spot between those careers, I hope to get more into design in the future.</p>
