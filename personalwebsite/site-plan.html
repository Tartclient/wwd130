        Baja California Sur
        officially the Free and Sovereign State of Baja California Sur
        Baja California is one of the regions with the lowest rainfall in the world, so prehistoric settlement is concentrated in the vicinity of water holes along the coast. Even today, Baja California is sparsely populated, around ten people per square kilometer. Settlement is concentrated in the cities on the coast, of which Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo are among the fastest growing resorts in Mexico.
        weather
        The west side, facing the Pacific with its cool temperatures, is impressively more pleasant than the east side facing the Gulf of California. Here the water temperature is up to 26 °C and it gets very hot during the day. The east side should therefore not be visited until November.
        Baja California Sur has the largest protected surface area in Mexico, 38.3 % of the state in 10 official protected areas: Bahía de Loreto National Park (510,472.2 acres), Cabo Pulmo National Park (17'570 acres), Espíritu Santo Archipelago National Park (120,228.70 acres), El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve (6,293,255.76 acres), Ojo de Liebre Lagoon Biosphere Reserve (196,026.15 acres), Sierra de la Laguna Biosphere Reserve (277,838.05 acres), Balandra Protection Area of Flora and Fauna (6,209.09 acres) and Cabo San Lucas Protection Area of Flora and Fauna (9,874.42 acres). Also, the islands located in Baja California Sur coastline on the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California are protected under Pacific Islands of the Baja California Peninsula Biosphere Reserve with Baja California, and Islands of the Gulf of California Protection Area of Flora and Fauna, which shares with the states of Baja California, Sinaloa and Sonora.

    <h3>Beaches</h3>
    <p>
      Balandra Beach
      Balandra Beach is an easy pick for the most beautiful beach in Mexico. Its crystal-clear turquoise waters and white sand dunes are set to a desert backdrop of red-hued hills and prickly cardón cactus that dot Baja California, making it feel like a remote, deserted beach even though it's only 30 minutes from the busy city of La Paz. 
      
      The calm, shallow waters of the lagoon are perfect for swimming, SUP boarding, and kayaking. At the inner edge of Balandra Beach, the fine sand and blue water transitions into a mangrove forest where thousands of small, brightly colored fish dart through the roots of the trees. While SUP boarding through the mangroves, we spotted long triggerfish, blue crabs, and a few herons looking for their next meal.

    <p>
      Cerritos Beach
      Cerritos Beach, is a beautiful and peaceful seashore located in the town of Todos Santos, Mexico, considered one of the best beaches in the area.
      If you are traveling to Baja California Sur, perhaps you'll want to spend a couple of days at the Magic Town of Todos Santos and explore all the beauty this special place has to offer.
      Located about 10 minutes from downtown Todos Santos, Cerritos Beach is a must-visit spot you'll not want to miss when you visit La Baja Sur.
      Prepare to enjoy Cerritos crystal-clear waters, great waves for surfing, relaxing seating areas with shades, and of course, lovely restaurants and bars nearby.
